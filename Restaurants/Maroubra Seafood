Comments: Maroubra sells both fresh and cooked seafood. The takeaway section has a good range of salad and battered seafood. It also offers over 20 types of meal packs. Personally, I like to purchase my own fish fillet and have it grilled. /The cost is $6/kg, which generally works out to be an additional $1. The fish is usually grilled perfectly, and comes with optional garlic and salt seasoning. /I have been going to Maroubra Seafood for years. The Takeaway section is #scrumptous.
