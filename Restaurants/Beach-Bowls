Comments: Had the best experience here! Friendly service, great food. Would come again! /Did not have a good time. Came to celebrate my 23rd birthday and was disappointed. The chicken was dry and did not meet expectations or recommendations made by my friends. /Yes real nice /Always a good time here the owner always comes up says hi how r u doin, feels like family /Brought by husband here for dinner he's never happy with anywhere we eat out but this place he loves and always comes back to!!
