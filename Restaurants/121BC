Comments: Not the best laksa I had in Sydney but it's pretty decent. The broth is flavorful. / This is a tiny little take-away counter in an Asian food court where competition is hot! I went on a Tuesday night around 6pm and the food court was fairly quiet though a lot of the restaurants were still open./Awesome spot for lunch
