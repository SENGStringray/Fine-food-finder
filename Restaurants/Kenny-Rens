Comments: It is excellent but really expensive./ Our first visit. Delicious authentic cuisine. No frills decor and acoustics a bit noisy but excellent value for money and exceptional customer service. The banquet for two (tasting plates) highly recommended and vegetarians well catered for. A big thumbs up!
