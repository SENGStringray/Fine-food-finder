Comments: This is one of those epic food places that you must go to, even if you aren't vegetarian. /Whilst you "know" this is a vegetarian restaurant, you still question whether you are eating prawn or chicken or pork. /I have brought some friends with me here and we were amazed by the delicious Vegetarian food. /First off, this restaurant is not easy to locate.
